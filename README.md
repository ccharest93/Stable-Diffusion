# Stable-Diffusion
Cleaned up the code from stable diffusion v2.1 removing a lot of the bells and whistle from the original to improve readability,
Implemented stricter GPU memory management allowing me to run inpainting of 768x768 image on a 6GB GPU.

I'll be working on a docker container to run this on AWS, but the roadmap for when i come back includes:
- Implementation of the other gradio functions
- Allowing for swapping of modules and finetuning

let me know if you think other directions might be interesting

‚≠ê if you find useful so i know to release more tools in this direction
